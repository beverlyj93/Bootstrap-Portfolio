            <p>I am 25 years old, an Army Veteran and divorced with two Daughters. My daughters names' are Averie,
                who's three years
                old and Addysen who is two years old. I have been working in the Information Technology field
                professionally since 2013
                where my first position was in the U.S. Army as an Information Technology Specialist. From there, I
                went on to get into
                Federal contracting for the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers where I held several I.T. related positions
                that ultimately led
                to me exiting the contracting industry and entering the private industry, where I am currently at as a
                Systems
                Administrator for a large I.T. company. Ever since 2009, I began having a lot of interest in software
                development/programming, so I began my first experience in such with a very minimalistic language known
                as Pawn, which
                was derived from the C language and used for server creation in a multiplayer mod known as SAMP for
                GTA: San Andreas.
                From there, I moved into Software Application development using C# along with various backened
                languages such as MySQL.
                After almost ten years of self-taught experience with C#, I decided to move into Web Development, which
                led to me where
                I am now
